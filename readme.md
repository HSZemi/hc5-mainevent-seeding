# HC4 Main Event Bracket Seeding Website

This is the code which we used to seed the bracket in the HC4 Main Event. This should give you a transparent view about the seeding process.

I didn't add the images we used because some of them are from Age of Empires II DE. Since you won't have images it will be white font on white ground with a lot of console errors :)
Checkout the console log for details there.

If you have any questions or feedback pm me :)
